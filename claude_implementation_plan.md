# Claude Implementation Plan
## Complete Calculation Engine Refactoring for DDT-1 Diagnostic Application

**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Author**: Claude (Sonnet 4.5)
**Status**: Implementation Ready

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis and implementation plan for refactoring the DDT-1 diagnostic application's calculation engine. The application currently has two conflicting calculation systems, and this refactoring will create a single, unified, flexible system that follows the specifications in `Calculations-DDT.txt` and `ph diagram-DDT.txt`.

**Critical Note**: The `Calculation_Migration_Plan.md` file mentioned by the user was not found in the repository. This plan has been created from scratch based on the specification files that ARE present.

## A. Codebase Analysis

### Current System Architecture

The application has **TWO SEPARATE, CONFLICTING calculation systems**:

#### 1. **Old System** (Currently Active in Calculations Tab)
- **Files**: `coolprop_calculator.py`, `calculations_widget.py`
- **Architecture**:
  - `ThermodynamicCalculator` class processes entire DataFrames
  - Hardcoded CSV column names (e.g., `'Right TXV Bulb '`, `'Suction Presure '`)
  - Calculates circuit-specific properties (LH, CTR, RH)
  - Uses CoolProp for thermodynamic properties
  - Produces comprehensive output with all state points
- **Strengths**:
  - Works end-to-end for current data
  - Comprehensive circuit-specific calculations
  - Produces Excel-exportable results
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Hardcoded column names (not flexible)
  - No support for user-provided rated inputs
  - No volumetric efficiency calculation from first principles
  - Cannot adapt to different sensor configurations

#### 2. **New System** (Partially Implemented, Not Used)
- **Files**: `calculation_orchestrator.py`, `calculation_engine.py`, `port_resolver.py`
- **Architecture**:
  - Uses diagram model + port_resolver pattern
  - Flexible sensor mapping via `sensor_roles` dictionary
  - Calculates 8-point cycle (states 1, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b)
  - More modular and maintainable
- **Strengths**:
  - Flexible - adapts to any sensor configuration
  - Clean separation of concerns
  - Uses modern port_resolver pattern
- **Weaknesses**:
  - **Missing critical features**:
    - No support for user rated inputs
    - No volumetric efficiency calculation (Step 1 from spec)
    - No per-row batch processing (Step 2 from spec)
    - No integration with Calculations tab UI
  - **Incomplete**: Only calculates state points, not final performance metrics

### Supporting Infrastructure

#### DataManager (`data_manager.py`)
- Central data management class
- Currently stores:
  - CSV data
  - Sensor mappings (sensor_roles dictionary)
  - Diagram model
  - Session state
- **Missing**: `rated_inputs = {}` dictionary for user manual inputs

#### Port Resolver System (`port_resolver.py`)
- Resolves sensor roles to actual CSV column names
- Functions like `resolve_mapped_sensor(model, 'Compressor', comp_id, 'SP')`
- Returns the actual CSV column name for a given port
- **Status**: Fully functional and ready to use

#### Inputs Widget (`inputs_widget.py`)
- Currently displays live sensor values
- **Missing**: UI for user to enter rated inputs

#### P-h Diagram Plotter (`ph_diagram_plotter.py`)
- Plots pressure-enthalpy diagrams
- Supports circuit-specific overlays (LH, CTR, RH)
- **Status**: Architecture is correct, but needs updated column names

## B. Specification Requirements

### From Calculations-DDT.txt

The specification describes a two-step calculation process:

#### **Step 1: Calculate Volumetric Efficiency (One-Time)**
```
eta_vol = m_dot_rated / m_dot_theoretical

Where:
- m_dot_rated: User input from datasheet (e.g., 211 lbm/hr)
- m_dot_theoretical = dens_rated * rph * disp_ft3
- rph = hz_rated * 3600
- dens_rated = CoolProp.PropsSI('D', 'T', Rated_Return_Gas_Temp_K, 'P', P_rated_sat, 'R290')
- P_rated_sat = CoolProp.PropsSI('P', 'T', Rated_Evap_Temp_K, 'Q', 0, 'R290')

Required User Inputs:
1. m_dot_rated (lbm/hr)
2. hz_rated (Hz)
3. disp_ft3 (ft³)
4. Rated_Evap_Temp (°F)
5. Rated_Return_Gas_Temp (°F)
```

#### **Step 2: Calculate Real-Time Performance (Per Row)**
```
For each row in CSV:
  Mass flow rate = Density * eta_vol * disp * (Comp.rpm / 60)

  Where:
  - Density: from "At compressor inlet" section
  - eta_vol: from Step 1
  - disp: converted from disp_ft3
  - Comp.rpm: from CSV sensor data

  Cooling cap = Mass flow rate * (H_in - H_out_avg)

  Where:
  - H_in: Enthalpy at compressor inlet (state 2b)
  - H_out_avg: Average of three TXV inlet enthalpies (h_4b_lh, h_4b_ctr, h_4b_rh)
```

#### **Required Calculations Per Row:**
1. **At Each Coil** (LH, CTR, RH):
   - T_sat (from suction pressure)
   - Superheat = T_outlet - T_sat
   - Density, Enthalpy, Entropy at coil outlet

2. **At Compressor Inlet**:
   - T_sat (from suction pressure)
   - Total Superheat = T_2b - T_sat
   - Density, Enthalpy, Entropy at state 2b

3. **At Condenser**:
   - T_sat (from discharge pressure)
   - Subcooling = T_sat - T_outlet

4. **At Each TXV** (LH, CTR, RH):
   - T_sat (from discharge pressure)
   - Subcooling = T_sat - T_inlet
   - Enthalpy at TXV inlet (h_4b)

### From ph diagram-DDT.txt

The P-h diagram must show:
1. **High-Pressure Line** (P_disch):
   - Three distinct TXV inlet points (3-LH, 3-CTR, 3-RH)
   - Each plotted using (P_disch, T_4b-lh/ctr/rh)

2. **Low-Pressure Line** (P_suction):
   - Three distinct evaporator outlet points
   - Each plotted using (P_suction, T_2a-LH/CTR/RH)
   - Compressor inlet point (T_2b) as the mixed average

3. **Main Cycle**: Standard 8-point cycle overlay

### From Calculations-DDT.xlsx - Sheet1.csv

The output table must have:
- Nested/hierarchical headers
- Sections: "At LH/CTR/RH Coil", "At compressor inlet", "At Condenser", "At TXV LH/CTR/RH", "TOTAL"
- Complex multi-level column structure

## E. Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Missing Rated Inputs
**Risk**: User hasn't entered rated inputs yet
**Mitigation**: Show clear error message, guide user to Inputs tab

### Risk 2: Sensor Mapping Incomplete
**Risk**: Required sensors not mapped in diagram
**Mitigation**: port_resolver returns None, show specific error about which port is missing

### Risk 3: Column Name Changes
**Risk**: CSV column names don't match expectations
**Mitigation**: Use port_resolver system exclusively (already handles this)

### Risk 4: CoolProp Errors
**Risk**: Invalid thermodynamic states
**Mitigation**: Wrap all CoolProp calls in try/except, log errors, continue processing

- [ ] Rated inputs can be entered and saved
- [ ] Volumetric efficiency calculates correctly
- [ ] Per-row performance calculations work
- [ ] Batch processing handles full CSV
- [ ] Calculations tab displays nested headers

## G. Gaps and Refinements to Original Plan

Since the `Calculation_Migration_Plan.md` file was missing, I created this plan from the specifications. Key observations:

### What Was Clear:
- Two-step calculation process (Step 1: eta_vol, Step 2: per-row)
- Required user inputs (5 rated values)
- Output format (nested table structure)
- P-h diagram multi-circuit requirements

### What I Inferred:
- Keep the new port_resolver-based architecture (it's superior)
- Retire coolprop_calculator.py completely
- Use QTreeWidget for nested table display
- Augment DataFrame with new columns rather than replacing

### What I Added:
- Specific function signatures for new calculation functions
- Detailed UI mockup for rated inputs
- Error handling strategy
- Session save/load for rated inputs
- Clear migration path from old to new system
