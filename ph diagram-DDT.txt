P-h Diagram: Ideal vs. Real vs. Multi-Circuit
Your hand-drawn diagram is a perfect representation of the ideal refrigeration cycle. The "real" cycle (described in the previous version) adds superheat and subcooling.
Your system is even more detailed: it's a "real, multi-circuit" cycle with three parallel evaporators. This guide explains how to plot all your individual sensor data on one diagram.
Your Drawing (The "Ideal" Cycle)
This diagram shows a perfect, textbook cycle with its four points.
* 1: Saturated Vapor (Compressor Inlet)
* 2: Superheated Vapor (Compressor Outlet)
* 3: Saturated Liquid (TXV Inlet)
* 4: Liquid/Vapor Mix (TXV Outlet)
Your System (The "Real" Cycle with Sensor Labels)
This is what the main state points from your data would look like on a "real" cycle diagram.
* Point 1: Compressor Inlet (Sensor T_2b)
* Point 2: Compressor Outlet (Sensor T_3a)
* Point 3: TXV Inlet (Average of T_4b)
* Point 4: TXV Outlet (Average of T_1a)
* Evaporator Outlet (Average of T_2a)
Plotting Your Individual Coils (This is your question)
You are correct that you have three different subcooling and superheat values. You can plot all of these on one diagram, and it will look like this:
On the High-Pressure Line (P_disch):
* Instead of one "Point 3", you will have three distinct points for your TXV inlets, all to the left of the liquid dome.
   * Point 3-LH: Plotted using P_disch and T_4b-lh
   * Point 3-CTR: Plotted using P_disch and T_4b-ctr
   * Point 3-RH: Plotted using P_disch and T_4b-rh
* Each of these will show a slightly different amount of subcooling.
On the Low-Pressure Line (P_suction):
* You will have three distinct points for your evaporator outlets, all to the right of the vapor dome.
   * Evap Out-LH: Plotted using P_suction and T_2a-LH
   * Evap Out-CTR: Plotted using P_suction and T_2a-ctr
   * Evap Out-RH: Plotted using P_suction and T_2a-RH
* Each of these will show a slightly different amount of superheat.
Plotting the Compressor Inlet (T_2b):
* Your main "Point 1" (T_2b) will be a fourth point on the low-pressure line.
* Its position will represent the mixed average of the three evaporator outlet streams after they have combined and traveled down the suction line, likely picking up a little more heat.
Conclusion:
You don't need three diagrams. You need one P-h diagram that shows two horizontal pressure lines. On those lines, you will plot your 3 individual subcooling points and 3 individual superheat points. This is the most accurate way to represent your system's real performance.
