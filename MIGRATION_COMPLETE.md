# 🎉 Calculation Engine Migration Complete

**Date Completed:** 2025-10-29
**Implementation Reference:** goal.md
**Session Branch:** `claude/refactor-calculation-engine-011CUap9sd3nSiYRE7M2b2iL`

---

## Executive Summary

The DDT-1 diagnostic application has been successfully refactored from two conflicting calculation systems into a **single, unified, flexible calculation engine**. This migration implements the complete specifications from:

- `Calculations-DDT.txt` - Two-step calculation logic
- `Calculations-DDT.xlsx - Sheet1.csv` - Nested table output format
- `ph diagram-DDT.txt` - Multi-circuit P-h diagram requirements
- `goal.md` - Complete migration plan

## What Changed: Before vs After

### **BEFORE: Two Conflicting Systems**

#### System A (Calculations Tab)
- **File:** `coolprop_calculator.py`
- ✓ Row-by-row processing
- ✗ Hardcoded CSV column names (brittle)
- ✗ Incomplete metrics (no mass flow, no cooling capacity)
- ✗ Cannot adapt to different sensor configurations

#### System B (Performance Tab)
- **Files:** `calculation_orchestrator.py`, `calculation_engine.py`
- ✓ Flexible port mapping (diagram-based)
- ✓ Calculates mass flow and cooling capacity
- ✗ Only works on aggregated values (not row-by-row)
- ✗ Missing volumetric efficiency calculation

### **AFTER: Unified System**

A single, powerful system that combines the best of both:

✅ **Flexible sensor mapping** via `port_resolver.py` pattern
✅ **Row-by-row batch processing** for entire CSV datasets
✅ **User-provided rated inputs** for volumetric efficiency
✅ **First-principles calculations** per Calculations-DDT.txt
✅ **Nested hierarchical output** matching Excel specification
✅ **Multi-circuit P-h diagrams** with 7+ state points

---

## Implementation Steps Completed

### ✅ Step 1: Rated Inputs Infrastructure
**Files Modified:** `data_manager.py`, `inputs_widget.py`

**What was added:**
- `rated_inputs` dictionary in DataManager for 5 user manual inputs:
  - `m_dot_rated_lbhr` - Rated mass flow rate
  - `hz_rated` - Rated compressor speed
  - `disp_ft3` - Compressor displacement
  - `rated_evap_temp_f` - Rated evaporator temperature
  - `rated_return_gas_temp_f` - Rated return gas temperature
- UI form in Inputs tab with QDoubleSpinBox widgets
- Session save/load support for persistence
- Validation and error handling

**Why this matters:**
These values are required for Step 1 calculation (volumetric efficiency). Without them, the system cannot calculate real-time performance accurately.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Core Calculation Functions
**File Modified:** `calculation_engine.py`

**What was added:**

#### Function 1: `calculate_volumetric_efficiency()`
Implements the one-time calculation from Calculations-DDT.txt:
```python
eta_vol = m_dot_rated / m_dot_theoretical
```

Uses CoolProp to calculate theoretical mass flow from:
- Rated saturation pressure (from rated evaporator temp)
- Rated return gas density
- Compressor displacement and speed

#### Function 2: `calculate_row_performance()`
Implements the per-row calculation:
```python
Mass flow rate = Density * eta_vol * disp * (RPM / 60)
Cooling cap = Mass flow rate * (H_in - H_out_avg)
```

Calculates 47 output columns per row, including:
- Properties at each evaporator circuit (LH, CTR, RH)
- Properties at compressor inlet
- Properties at condenser
- Properties at each TXV (LH, CTR, RH)
- Total mass flow and cooling capacity

**Why this matters:**
These are the core thermodynamic calculations. They use the flexible port mapping system to work with ANY sensor configuration, not just hardcoded column names.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Batch Processing Orchestrator
**File Modified:** `calculation_orchestrator.py`

**What was added:**

#### Main Function: `run_batch_processing()`
The new entry point that replaces `coolprop_calculator.py` entirely.

**Process flow:**
1. **Validate inputs** - Check rated inputs exist
2. **Calculate eta_vol** - One-time calculation (Step 1)
3. **Build sensor map** - Use port_resolver to map logical roles to CSV columns
4. **Process all rows** - Apply `calculate_row_performance()` to each row
5. **Return DataFrame** - Augmented with 47 new calculated columns

**Key innovation: REQUIRED_SENSOR_ROLES table**

Maps logical sensor roles to component ports with property filters:
```python
'T_2a-LH': [('Evaporator', 'outlet_circuit_1', {'circuit_label': 'Left'})]
'T_4b-lh': [('TXV', 'inlet', {'circuit_label': 'Left'})]
```

This allows the system to adapt to:
- Different component IDs
- Different sensor names
- Different circuit configurations
- ANY CSV column naming scheme

**Why this matters:**
This is the "brain" that ties everything together. It ensures the system is truly flexible and maintainable.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Calculations Tab UI Rebuild
**File Completely Rewritten:** `calculations_widget.py`

**What was replaced:**
- Old QTableWidget (simple flat table)
- Dependency on `coolprop_calculator.py`

**What was built:**

#### Custom `NestedHeaderView` Class
A custom QHeaderView that renders **two-row hierarchical headers**:
- **Row 1:** Group labels (e.g., "AT LH coil", "At compressor inlet")
- **Row 2:** Column labels (e.g., "T_2a-LH", "T_sat.lh", "S.H_lh")

Matches the exact structure from Calculations-DDT.xlsx - Sheet1.csv

#### Rebuilt `CalculationsWidget` Class
- Uses QTreeWidget for hierarchical data display
- Integrates with `run_batch_processing()` orchestrator
- "Run" button triggers full batch calculation
- Export to CSV preserves all 47 calculated columns
- Comprehensive error handling with user feedback

**Why this matters:**
This provides the professional, specification-compliant output format. The nested headers make it clear which properties belong to which circuit/component.

---

### ✅ Step 5: P-h Diagram Integration
**Files Modified:** `ph_diagram_plotter.py`, `ph_diagram_widget.py`

**What was updated:**

#### In `ph_diagram_plotter.py`:
- Updated `convert_diagram_model_to_points()` to read NEW column names
- Maps from psig pressures to Pa (Pascals)
- Extracts:
  - Compressor inlet: `'Enthalpy'`
  - Evaporator outlets: `'H_coil lh'`, `'H_coil ctr'`, `'H_coil rh'`
  - TXV inlets: `'Enthalpy_txv_lh'`, `'Enthalpy_txv_ctr'`, `'Enthalpy_txv_rh'`

#### In `ph_diagram_widget.py`:
- Updated `_extract_common_points()` for compressor inlet (state 2b)
- Updated `_extract_circuit_points()` for 3 superheat + 3 subcooling points
- Added pressure conversion helpers (psig → Pa)

**Result:**
Per ph diagram-DDT.txt specification, the diagram now shows:

**On High-Pressure Line (P_disch):**
- 3 distinct TXV inlet points (subcooling)

**On Low-Pressure Line (P_suction):**
- 3 distinct evaporator outlet points (superheat)
- 1 compressor inlet point (mixed average)

**Why this matters:**
This provides accurate visualization of the multi-circuit system's thermodynamic state. Each circuit's performance can be independently evaluated.

---

### ✅ Step 6: Deprecate Old System
**File Modified:** `coolprop_calculator.py`

**What was done:**
- Added prominent deprecation warning in docstring
- Added runtime `DeprecationWarning`
- Documented replacement system
- File retained for reference only

**Verified:**
- No active imports in production code ✓
- `calculations_widget.py` uses `run_batch_processing()` ✓
- Only test/debug scripts import old calculator (acceptable)

**Why this matters:**
Clear deprecation prevents future developers from using the old, inflexible system. All new work will use the unified engine.

[run_batch_processing() orchestrator]
    ├─ Step 1: calculate_volumetric_efficiency(rated_inputs)
    │           └─ Returns eta_vol
    ├─ Step 2: Build sensor_map using port_resolver
    │           └─ Maps logical roles to CSV columns
    └─ Step 3: For each row in DataFrame:
                └─ calculate_row_performance(row, sensor_map, eta_vol)
                    └─ Returns 47 calculated columns

```

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Port Resolver Pattern**
   - Separates sensor mapping from calculation logic
   - Allows system to adapt to any sensor configuration
   - Single source of truth: diagram model

2. **Two-Step Calculation**
   - Step 1: One-time volumetric efficiency (from rated inputs)
   - Step 2: Row-by-row performance (using eta_vol)
   - Follows thermodynamic first principles

3. **Flexible Column Mapping**
   - REQUIRED_SENSOR_ROLES table defines what's needed
   - port_resolver finds actual CSV column names
   - System works regardless of CSV structure

4. **Nested Header Rendering**
   - Custom QHeaderView with paintEvent override
   - Two-row hierarchical structure
   - Professional, specification-compliant output
